## NoteCards

## Lab 1

### App Description
The objective of this application is to develop a minor notecard app where users can enter in their notes. From the notes, a corresponding
question and sets of wrong and right answers will be produced, to question the user on their notes. Eventually, I intend to add in a
"correct" counter, and logic for parsing out concepts from the notes.

For Lab 1, the objective is to make a basic multiple choice system that differentiates between the wrong and right answers, and to allow
the user to toggle between basic flashcard functionality and quizzing.
